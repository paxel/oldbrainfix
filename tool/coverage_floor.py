"""Coverage floors that may only rise (#232, Q559 (a), Q560 (a)).

    python3 tool/coverage_floor.py <group> <lcov file> [floors file [badge dir]]

Keeps only the group's own source files in the LCOV file (rewritten in
place, so SonarQube Cloud imports what the floor measured), computes the
line coverage, and compares it with the group's floor in the floors file
(default: tool/coverage-floors.txt):

- below the floor: exit 1;
- a whole percent or more above it: the floor is raised in the file, for
  the user to commit;
- otherwise the file is left alone.

Floors are whole percents, rounded down (see the floors file).

It also writes the group's README badge, a shields.io endpoint file
(default: .github/badges/coverage-<group>.json), with the measured value
rounded down to one decimal, committed with the floors.
