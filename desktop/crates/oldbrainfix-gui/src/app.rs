//! The window (UI laws, "Desktop"): the Agenda, Areas and Topics on the
//! left, the capture field and the Agenda or the Notes of the selection
//! in the middle as embossed cards, the selected Note's editor or a
//! Routine's editor on the right.
//!
//! The window opens on the Agenda (UI laws, "Agenda"): the Missed
//! Summary until "Seen", the "x Unsorted" banner, today's all-day and
//! then timed Occurrences, a gap, and tomorrow's dimmed, all of them
//! checkable. Its gear leads to this Device's Settings, its alarm button
//! to a new Routine. A Note spawns Routines and Reminders from its
//! editor; deleting a Note that spawned some asks whether they go too.
//!
//! Every change goes through `oldbrainfix_core`, which writes the entries
//! the phone's core writes. A card dragged onto an Area or Topic on the
//! left is filed there. Keys replace swipes (UI laws, "Navigation"):
//! Alt+Left or the mouse's back button goes back one level, a Topic to
//! its Area and an Area, Unsorted or the trash to All Notes; Alt+Right or
//! the mouse's forward button goes forward into the last selected Area,
//! and from an Area into its last selected Topic. The keys rest while
//! text is being typed, where Alt+arrows move the cursor.
